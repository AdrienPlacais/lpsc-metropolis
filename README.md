## lpsc-metropolis

This is an adaptation of Metropolis theme to match LPSC laboratory colors.

---

Metropolis is a simple, modern Beamer theme suitable for anyone to use.
It tries to minimize noise and maximize space for content; the only visual flourish it offers is an (optional) progress bar added to each slide.
The core design principles of the theme were described in a blog post [here](http://bloerg.net/2014/09/20/a-modern-beamer-theme.html).
